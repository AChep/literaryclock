Creating your Literary Clock
----------------
We welcome all developers to use our source code to create applications on our platform.
There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment:

1. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo as your app's logo.
2. Please remember to read and follow the [license][4].

Versioning
----------------
For transparency in a release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, a project should be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we should adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and constructed with the following guidelines:
- Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps only the patch
